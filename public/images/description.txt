About this game

Guide a virgin adventurer through his first fights and help him learn both about himself and how to use the powers he didn't realize he had. Experience an involved story that slowly reveals more about the world about you as you journey through multiple visually appealing and varied locations, from forests to caves to castles.

Monster Souls has challenging gameplay that requires strategic thinking beyond simply hitting the attack buttons. Defend yourself from monsters that want to defeat and dominate you-in that order... or surrender to them and let them have their way. Gain the power of monsters through intimate contact, and learn how to use their own forms and abilities against them for your victory!

Gain a pair of companions to help you along your way. Develop their abilities to help you survive the trials ahead. You can even romance them, or instead spend your time with as many men as you can find.
